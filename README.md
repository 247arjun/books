This project is a collection of all the books Iâ€™ve read (or intend to read), with short summaries.

# Groups
I have organized the collection into a few groups
## Fiction
This group contains a list of all genres of fiction (sci-fi etc.)
## Non-Fiction
### Technical (Computer Science) Books
This group has books from all fields of Computer Science - I will not group these any further, for discoverability
### Non-technical Books
This group has non-fiction books from various fields - biographies, manuals from other non-CompSci areas etc.
